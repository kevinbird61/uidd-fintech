	"home_frame_text": "A network bridge is a computer device that creates a single aggregate network from multiple communication networks or network segments. This function is called network bridging. Bridging is distinct from routing, which allows multiple different networks to communicate independently while remaining separate. In the OSI model, bridging is performed in the first two layers, below the network layer bridge. There are four types of network brigding technologies: simple bridging, multiport bridging, learning or transparent bridging, and source route bridging. A simple bridge connects two network segments."
